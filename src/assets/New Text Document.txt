Git Ignore Firebase Config
Hello folks,

I have a "firebase" folder in the "src" folder of my React app. I would like to ignore the "firebase_config.js" file or the whole "firebase" folder, but no matter what I put in the .gitignore file, VS Code is recognizing changes.


If you're already tracking those files, then you have to:

git rm --cached -r .

Update .gitignore (in your case just firebase/ will suffice), then:

git add .

git commit -m "Updated .gitignore"
